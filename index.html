  <p> Hi! Thank you for visiting my site! My name is Andrew Lee and I'm a nerd for all things computer related. I am currently working 
    in the IT field where most of the time I am working on other peoples computers. I graduated from a small public school in Colorado where I received a 
    B.S in Computer Science and Cyber Science. If I am not working on anything computer related then I am most likely iceskating or cooking.
